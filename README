EmojiEnabler

This app allows you to enable Emoji on non-jailbroken iPhones.
Simply run the app, tap Enable Emoji, and then go to System Preferences, General, Keyboards, International, Japanes, and toggle Emoji on.

Note that compiling this app does require having a valid dev certificate. You may have to change the app ID to match an existing provisioning profile or create a new one. If you have a profile that matches just the wildcard * then you should be fine.

The original source for this app comes from http://westbaer.de/post/61339115/emojis, though it has been slightly modified to work on non-jailbroken iPhones.
